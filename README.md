# SwiftUI-Frameworks

Another great beginner level app from Sean Allen's course. This app cleared a lot of fundamental things and also messed up my brain a few times ngl. Following are the features in the app-
* Contains a grid of different frameworks offered by Apple (We can customize them to be anything we want)
* Those can be clicked to open a detailed view
* Can click the 'learn more' button to further open a Safari webpage
<br>
<br>
My learnings from this app-
- Learnt about LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid
- Implemented a ForEach loop to loop through the array of the data
- Added a NavigationView, later to be updated to the newest NavigationStack (iOS 16)
- Implmented sheets
- Understood (a little bit) about MVVM and moving data around.
- Tried to understand UIKit integration by adding the SafariViewController
<br>
<br>
Overall, I feel this app was a bit challenging, but definately introduced me to the core concepts of an iOS app. I hope these concepts will get more and more clear as I build more and more apps. Cheers!
